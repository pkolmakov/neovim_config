# I think it's better to show commits in pluggin file
1) I used 
0fd56dd Release v0.0.81
for coc.nvim because it was stable with my vim
(there were errors on tab and others)

2) I downloaded fugitive from git release in the same way
(couldn't open NERDTree when I use git)

3) to update changes in vim need to type so % command
